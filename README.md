# express-js-serversiderender-todolist
The goal of this project is to create a server-side rendered to-do list application using the Express.js framework. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks in a to-do list.

Technical Requirements:

Use Express.js as the web framework.
Use a template engine (e.g., EJS or Handlebars) to render the HTML pages.
Use MongoDB or another database to store the to-do list items.
Implement CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) for the to-do list items.
Use AJAX to implement asynchronous operations (e.g., updating an item without refreshing the page).
Implement user authentication and authorization to allow only authorized users to access the application.
Use Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling the application.
Functional Requirements:

The application should allow users to add tasks to the to-do list.
The application should allow users to view their tasks.
The application should allow users to edit tasks.
The application should allow users to delete tasks.
The application should display a message when a task is added, edited, or deleted.
The application should allow users to mark tasks as completed.
The application should allow users to filter tasks based on their completion status.
The application should have a search bar to search for tasks by keywords.
The application should have user registration and login functionality.
The application should have a password reset feature.
Project Deliverables:

Source code of the server-side rendered to-do list application.
Documentation on how to set up and run the application.
A demonstration video of the application's features and functionality.
A report detailing the project's goals, requirements, design, and implementation.
